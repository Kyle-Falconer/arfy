# Arfy

Arfy checks if there is a new dog added to the [Animal Rescue Foundation Website](https://www.arflife.org/), then sends an email with that dog's information.

This project uses web scraping and aims to be [polite](https://blog.scrapinghub.com/2016/08/25/how-to-crawl-the-web-politely-with-scrapy/).
